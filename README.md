## HTML-and-CSS-Remix-Drawing

# Original Source
For this remix assignment, I used [Joey's HTML-and-CSS-Drawing](https://github.com/joey1005/HTML-and-CSS-drawing) and created a new version of it. Joey's original work, named "The Birth of Venus", was a statue of Venus standing in the middle of the ocean, with music gently playing in the background. The scene was very comforting and peaceful.

# My Interpretation
In my version of interpretation, I added more lively elements to the scene. Instead of having the Venus statue standing in the ocean, I had it hidden behind a glowing beam. When one hovers over the statue, it would then come forward to the center. Moreover, if one clicks on the statue, it will turn a full circle.

I also added some fish to the scene and had them jumping forward. The fish will roll in reaction to one's hovering over it.
